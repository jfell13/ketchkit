# 🧪 KetchKit

**KetchKit** is a lightweight molecular sketching and property analysis tool built with [Ketcher](https://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/ketcher/) and [RDKit.js](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit-js). It allows users to draw molecules, extract SMILES and MOL formats, and compute Crippen properties (ClogP and MR) in the browser.
